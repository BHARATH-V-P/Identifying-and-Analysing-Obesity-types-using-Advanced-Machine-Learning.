# Identifying-and-Analysing-Obesity-types-using-Advanced-Machine-Learning.

This project aims to build a classification model to predict an individualâ€™s health category based on several independent variables such as height, weight, frequency of water consumption, and calorie intake. While weight and height are primary indicators of overall health, the dataset and model explore how additional factors, including dietary habits and physical activity, influence general health. The project involves creating insightful visualizations and optimizing machine learning models to provide a comprehensive analysis of these factors and their impact on health status.

## Introduction


Creating a tuned prediction model to determine the quality of wine based on the available independent variables that categorize broadly as chemical properties. Identifying the data source for training and verifying its similarity with the original dataset. The overall dataset is highly imbalanced, with class proportions going as low as 0.5%. The project involves identifying features that best help train the model with as much reduced noise as possible. A cross-validation strategy is deployed to help get a better estimate of the reliability of the models. Direct correlation of features helps give a brief idea of the importance of specific features in correctly classifying the minority classes. Some of the model types used for machine learning include SVC, Random Forest Classifier, XGB Classifier, and LGB Classifier. The KPI selected for evaluation is the Cohen Kappa Score.
